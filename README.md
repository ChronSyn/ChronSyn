### Hi! :wave:

**I'm Scott, a full stack developer that specialises in Javascript and Typescript.**

I've worked with lots of different tech over the years, but as a coder, here's my path:

 - Delphi (2006 - 2010)
 - Delphi Firemonkey (2010/2011 - 2013)
 - JQuery (2014 - 2016)
 - Node, Socket.io (2014 - Present)
 - AngularJS (v1) (2016 - 2017)
 - Angular (v2 - v6) (2017 - 2018)
 - Typescript, React, MobX, React Native (2018 - Present)
 - Apollo, C# (2019 - Present)
 
I'm the author behind several long-discontinued projects:

 - VTemp: A GPU temperature monitor for NVIDIA graphics cards (2010 - 2013)
 - Boiled: An SSD-optimizer for steam games (2011 - 2013)
 - MoPAndBugget: An unofficial bug reporting tool for an online gaming beta (2012)
 
Those projects do not have source available, and there are no plans for them to return. Those were the last delphi projects I worked on, and I've been focused on a Javascript ever since. I also write C# (Winforms) for some projects, though that is if a solution can't be built in JS (e.g. Windows projects which require a window handle).

Though many of my projects are private or closed-source, here's a quick breakdown of some of the things I've done.

### Future Plans

Here's a list of things I'd like to do in the future:

 - Learn .NET Core
 - Try Angular again
 - Use Electron for a project
 - Find a project suitable to be built in Deno
