### Hi! :wave:

**I'm Scott, a full stack developer that specialises in Javascript and Typescript.**

I've worked with lots of different tech over the years, but as a coder, here's my path:

 - Delphi (2006 - 2010)
 - Delphi Firemonkey (2010 - 2013)
 - JQuery (2014 - 2016)
 - Node, Express, Socket.io (2014 - Present [kinda - not using it much these days])
 - AngularJS (v1) (2016 - 2017)
 - Angular (v2 - v6) (2017 - 2018)
 - Typescript, React, MobX, React Native, Expo (2018 - Present)
 - C# (2019 - 2020)
 - Apollo Server + Client (2019 - Present)
 - Supabase (2021 - Present)

Though many of my projects are private or closed-source, here's a quick breakdown of some of the things I've done.

### Summary
 - :page_facing_up: Tools and tech: Typescript, React Native, Expo, Apollo, Node, GraphQL, Apollo
 - :whale: I've deployed services and websites using Docker
 - :card_index: I created [Quicache](https://github.com/ChronSyn/quiCache) (pronounced Key-cache, or Kwi-cache [as in Quick-cache] -- either is fine), a memory-based JS key-value data cache
 - :balloon: I created [JS-ThemeGen](https://github.com/ChronSyn/themegen), a Javascript library for quickly generating colour shades
 - :wrench: I've built Windows service applications in Node, including a hardware bridge for Windows using Node and C#, allowing a front-end to interact with hardware devices like thermal printers
 - :station: I built [TSOpenLDB](https://github.com/ChronSyn/TSOpenLDB), a Typescript-first library for interacting with the UK National Rail web service
 - :train2: I'm the developer of the [Railscope](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iocube.pantherV2) mobile app - currently unavailable, pending an update
 - :tram: I'm building a library for working with the Transport for London API
 - :bus: I've worked with the open data for UK bus data
 - :computer: I code on Windows, but prefer Powershell or WSL as my terminal of choice where available
 - :penguin: I've worked with Linux servers, and setup tools like Nginx, etc
 - :lock: I've deployed commercial Windows projects to client systems with Intune via Azure
 - :book: Strong advocate of understandable documentation

### Awesome tools I use

 - [Supabase](https://supabase.io) - An open-source alternative to Firebase
 - [Expo](https://expo.io) - A framework for developing, building and deploying React Native applications
 - [Moti](https://moti.fyi) - A React Native library for building animated components (Based on [Reanimated 2](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/))

### So many repos!

I have a lot of private repos for my own projects, but most of the public repos I have are forks of other libraries that I feel are really useful. I haven't used all of them, but each of them feels great enough to keep a copy of. I'm not a fan of great libraries or projects disappearing or being removed, so I've forked many over time to keep them available.
