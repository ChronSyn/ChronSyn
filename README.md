### Hi! :wave:

**I'm Scott, a full stack developer that specialises in Javascript and Typescript.**

## My path through technology

This is a timeline of the main technologies I've used over the years. Those marked as 'commercial' were used in both commercial and non-commercial projects, while those marked as non-commercial were only used in personal/non-commercial projects.

 - Delphi (2006 - 2010, non-commercial)
 - Delphi Firemonkey (2010 - 2013, non-commercial)
 - JQuery (2014 - 2016, commercial)
 - Node, Express (2014 - Present, commercial)
 - Socket.io (2014 - 2018, commercial)
 - AngularJS (v1) (2016 - 2017, non-commercial)
 - Angular (v2 - v6) (2017 - 2018, non-commercial)
 - Typescript, React, MobX, React Native, Expo (2018 - Present, commercial)
 - Docker (2018 - present, commercial)
 - C# (2019 - 2020, commercial)
 - Apollo Server + Client (2019 - 2023, commercial)
 - Supabase (2021 - Present, commercial)
 - Hasura (2022 - 2023, non-commercial) 


### Summary
 - I created [Quicache](https://github.com/ChronSyn/quiCache) (pronounced Key-cache, or Kwi-cache [as in Quick-cache] -- either is fine), a memory-based JS key-value data cache
 - I created [JS-ThemeGen](https://github.com/ChronSyn/themegen), a Javascript library for quickly generating colour shades
 - I created [TSOpenLDB](https://github.com/TheTransportLab/TSOpenLDB), a library for interacting with the UK National Rail Open LDB staff API
 - I've worked on a large number of commercial React and React Native projects for clients across the world

Most people know me as a coder, but I've also got 20 years experience with non-code related IT stuff. Yes, I can probably fix your computer.

### Awesome tools I use

 - [Supabase](https://supabase.io) - An open-source alternative to Firebase
 - [Expo](https://expo.io) - A framework for developing, building and deploying React Native applications
 - [Moti](https://moti.fyi) - A React Native library for building animated components (Based on [Reanimated 2](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/))
 - [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) - A docker container for helping to manage your docker containers

### So many repos!

Many of my repos are forks of useful projects. I don't use all of them, but I like to keep a copy of projects that I think might be worth looking into in future.
