### Hi! :wave:

**I'm Scott, a full stack developer that specialises in Javascript and Typescript.**

## My path through technology

 - Delphi (2006 - 2010)
 - Delphi Firemonkey (2010 - 2013)
 - JQuery (2014 - 2016)
 - Node, Express
 - Socket.io (2014 - Present [kinda - not using it much these days])
 - AngularJS (v1) (2016 - 2017)
 - Angular (v2 - v6) (2017 - 2018)
 - Typescript, React, MobX, React Native, Expo (2018 - Present)
 - C# (2019 - 2020)
 - Apollo Server + Client (2019 - Present)
 - Supabase (2021 - Present)

### Summary
 - I created [Quicache](https://github.com/ChronSyn/quiCache) (pronounced Key-cache, or Kwi-cache [as in Quick-cache] -- either is fine), a memory-based JS key-value data cache
 - I created [JS-ThemeGen](https://github.com/ChronSyn/themegen), a Javascript library for quickly generating colour shades
 - I created [TheTransportLab](https://thetransportlab.com), a GraphQL API for retrieving rail, TfL tube, and bus transit data in the UK
 - I created [TSOpenLDB](https://github.com/TheTransportLab/TSOpenLDB), a library for interacting with the UK National Rail Open LDB staff API
 - I'm an avid fan and contributor to [Supabase](https://supabase.io), and help the community in their Discord server
 - I've worked on a large number of commercial React and React Native projects for clients across the world
 - I've created several thousand proof of concept projects over the years, and less than 5% of them ever get built out to real projects

Most people know me as a coder, but I've also got 20 years experience with non-code related IT stuff.

### Awesome tools I use

 - [Supabase](https://supabase.io) - An open-source alternative to Firebase
 - [Expo](https://expo.io) - A framework for developing, building and deploying React Native applications
 - [Moti](https://moti.fyi) - A React Native library for building animated components (Based on [Reanimated 2](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/))
 - [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io/) - A docker container for helping to manage your docker containers

### So many repos!

Many of my repos are forks of useful projects. I don't use all of them, but I like to keep a copy of projects that I think might be worth looking into in future.
